# Messaging4000

Use of the https://github.com/jamailun/standardSocket librairie to do a simple server/client application.

# Tutorial

## Servers

- Open the ports of your server. This app' will run on port 9000. (I will make it editable in the future).
- Open some others port (like 9001, 9002, ...) to create rooms on those ports.
- Run the .jar's server file.
- Enter commands. Type `help` for help. You can create room with `+ 9001 My ultimate discussion room` for example. Delete with `- 9001`.
- Enjoy !

## Clients

- Run the .jar's client file.
- Enter address and port (`127.0.0.1:9000` for example). Enter nickname and press 'Connexion'.
- Choose one of the free rooms.
- Tchat !
